* WELCOME TO MY DOTFILES
_____________________________________________________________________________

This repo is in the PUBLIC DOMAIN see ./.gitea/LICENSE

My system configurations are intended to be bland, simple and functional. The 
programs required to install this project are commonly packaged in most 
distributions, I would recommend void Linux as it is the operating system I 
have tested these on.

This repository is intended for my personal use by acting as a backup when I 
need to move to a computer or have to reinstall void. The files, especially the 
shell scripts included are poorly written (they're good enough to get by with). 
I would recommend you to pick and choose the bits and peaces you want, rather 
than installing all the configurations to your setup

For some reason if you do want to install my dot files to your system just 
clone this repository to your home directory, all the dependencies needed to 
run this project are listed in ~/.local/share/doc/packages.txt. Once again I 
would not recommend this, its a really fucking stupid idea to do so.
