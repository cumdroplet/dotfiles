My system configurations are intended to be bland, simple, and functional. The
programmes required to install this project are commonly packaged in most
distributions. I would recommend Void Linux, as it is the operating system I
have tested these on.

This repository is intended for my personal use by acting as a backup when I
need to move to a new computer or have to reinstall Void. The files —
especially the shell scripts included — are poorly written (they're just good
enough to get by with). I would recommend picking and choosing the bits and
pieces you want, rather than installing all the configurations onto your setup.

For some reason, if you do want to install my dotfiles on your system, just
clone this repository into your home directory. All the dependencies needed to
run this project are listed in ~/.local/share/packages. Once again, I would not
recommend this — it's a really fucking stupid idea to do so.
